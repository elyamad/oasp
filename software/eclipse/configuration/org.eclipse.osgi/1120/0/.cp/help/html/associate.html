<h1>Associate a project with SonarQube</h1>
<p>When started, the wizard will contact all referenced SonarQube servers and try to find the better match based on your Eclipse project name.</p>
<p>When no match is found or <em>when the current choice is not what you expect</em> you can click in the "SonarQube project" column. This is a text field with
autocompletion. Like in SonarQube server search engine it works when you have typed at least 3 characters.</p>
